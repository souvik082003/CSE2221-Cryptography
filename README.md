# 🔐 Cryptography Interactive Lab

A modern, responsive dashboard designed for Computer Science students to explore and experiment with classical encryption techniques. This project provides a visual way to understand how mathematical shifts and transpositions transform plaintext into ciphertext.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🧩 Modules Included
The portal integrates several interactive ciphers:
* **Vigenère Cipher:** Explore polyalphabetic substitution.
* **Hill Cipher:** Matrix-based polygraphic encryption using modular arithmetic.
* **Playfair Cipher:** Digraph substitution using a 5x5 character grid.
* **Rail Fence Cipher:** Visualization of transposition (zig-zag) patterns.
* **Cryptanalysis:** Tools for frequency analysis and brute-force testing.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
* **Design:** Modern Glassmorphism & Dark Mode UI
* **Typography:** Plus Jakarta Sans & FontAwesome Icons

## 📂 Project Navigation
Since the project is structured as a single-page portal, you can navigate back to the main menu from any cipher module using the **"Back to Dashboard"** button located at the bottom of each page.
